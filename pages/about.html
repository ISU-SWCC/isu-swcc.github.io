            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in the heart of Iowa's agricultural landscape, the Soil and Water Conservation Club (SWCC) at
                Iowa State University has a rich tradition of promoting sustainable land and water management practices.
                Since its inception, the club has served as a bridge between academic learning and professional
                application, bringing together students from diverse backgrounds who share a common goal: preserving our
                most vital natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club's early years were marked by grassroots initiatives, student-led field trips to watershed
                management sites, and collaborative projects with local conservation districts. Over the decades, SWCC
                has grown into a premier student organization, recognized for its commitment to environmental
                stewardship and its contribution to the university's mission of practical, hands-on education.
